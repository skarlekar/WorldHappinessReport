#### Input

-   Happiness comments & demographics from Kaggle (CSV in S3)
    
-   GDP from Happy Planet Index (JSON in S3)
    
-   Country ISO codes from Kaggle (Tabular data in Postgres)
    

#### Processing

-   Crawl all data & generate Data Catalog
    
-   Build ETL job (PySpark) to load Country ISO code into Postgres managed RDS
    
-   Combine Comments, Demographics in CSV format with GDP data in JSON format along with Country ISO codes in RDS to generate denormalized Happiness Report in CSV format
    
-   Build an Athena query to vend Happiness Report using SQL query
    
-   Build a Microservice using Lambda/Fargate container to expose Happiness data through an API
    
-   Build a single-page web application hosted on S3 to visualize the Happiness Report
    

#### Output

-   World Happiness Report - Charts
